# Next Generation Front-End for WooCommerce

## Introduction

The goal of WooNuxt is to provide a modern, fast, and SEO friendly front-end for WooCommerce. It's built on top of Nuxt 3 and uses the WPGraphQL API to retrieve all the data it needs. It's also fully customizable and can be extended with your own components and modules. You can see a live demo of WooNuxt by clicking the button below.
